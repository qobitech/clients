INTENT : to empathize with those struggling to make something of themselves in words that resonates with their
         innermost mindset, the doubt, the hope, the success, the failure, the disappointments, the will to keep on
         fighting, that they might give up and give in, accept defeat, stay conquered for a short time, but
         get up another day to continue the fight, the fight for what exactly? to make more money? wealth?
         to be happy? to be free? to get the respect they deserve? to be able to buy whatever they want?
         what exactly?



how long have i been dreaming
how long have i been scared
how long have i been blessed
but the doubt always prevailed...

How long do i have to keep believing
How long do i have to keep fighting
How long do i have to keep waiting
as if all these aint taking a toll on me...

Listen girl, right now i'm on the run
dont really understand what's going on
Just remember girl, u in my heart
Take care, i cant say much, 
because i got to go
