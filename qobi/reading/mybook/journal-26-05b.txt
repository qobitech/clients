the idea that one needs to find ways to stay motivated has always existed in my mind.

Because at times, i'd be in the zone, my soul on fire, desire burning brightest, 
i knew i could conquer the world....i felt real power.

And other times, i lost all will to even look at myself in the mirror, 
a complete loser, started thinking about my ex girlfriend, maybe she saw i was a loser
thats why things ended badly, yeah my mind was that fucked up.

And i'm conscious of it all, the highs, the lows, and i ask myself how do i maintain the high,
keep the fire of desire burning in my soul,, work like a maniac, think up marvelous new ways 
to be wealthy, a billionaire.

So i started doing stuff like listening to youtube content writers whose content were inspiring,
and it helped, it really helped.

Also, i started reading again.

One thing i'm finding hard to do is continue learning Japanese,

Long story short, I have to be discipined, i just have to, i dont have a choice but to be disciplined and fight my
way to success.

To be in the moment at all times, reject the lows and embrace the highs with everything in me,
because therein lies the greatness that i need in my life.

I have to be a monster....
