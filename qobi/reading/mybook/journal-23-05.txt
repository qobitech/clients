lately, i've lost all will to act but not to dream...

As a little boy growing up, i would lock myself in my room, close the curtains so it would be dark,

and i would dream, fantasize (cant really remember what it is i was dreaming about) but it was fun,

like i couldnt wait to just lock myself away and dream, i hated being around people.

Just me in the dark, lying down and dreaming.

But now, i just lay down doing almost nothing, no fun thought coming to mind,

plus my guitar is far away in a recording studio, toolazy to go get it.

And i know in the deepest of my heart i can do better...

But i'm just tired...

What do i do to revive that burning desire to enjoy life as i once did, and to keep it that way.

There has to be a way to do so.
