so i worked all night yesterday, slept around 5am, woke up at 8am
and continued working on a web application that i find interesting.

Even though its a portfolio website for a colleague of mine, it was the first time
i did something like that, made me proud of myself.

At one point i was just writing a buch of code, not sure it was going to work,
was almost asleep and then i ran the code and the damn thing worked like a charm,
i laughed out loud, i'm sure i woke some of my neighbors but it was joy sha,
like i had given up already after many trial and error and i just decided to give
it one last try, relying on a hunch to do it in a whole different way.

i was sure it was a waste of my time, and at that point i was lying on my bed,
waiting for the code to not work so i can feel justified and go to sleep 
but when it worked sleep passed away, never been more alive as at that moment.

Made me feel like one bad ass programmer like that (no name come to mind sha).
Anyway i'm almost done with the application and will present to my colleague soonest,

Will tell you all about it when its launched.

Bye for now
